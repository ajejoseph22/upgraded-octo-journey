# Installation Instructions
* Clone the repo
* Run `npm install` from the root folder
* Start the React server by running `npm start` from the root folder
* Navigate to `localhost:3000` in your browser

# Things I was able to implement
* The `share feedback` page. The app user can view a list of users and opt to answr questions about them. These questions are saved in-state, so refreshing the page will do away with the data.
* The `my-feedback` page. The user can view his/her feedback for all the users for which he gave.

# Things I was NOT able to implement
* The signin/signup page
* Some of the UI features e.g. the user profile area at the extreme right of the NavBar
* Some non-core pages/UI features e.g the 404 not found page, the loading page as presented in the design (I created my own loading page)

# If I had a week to work on it...
* I would finish up the leftover pages/features (404, signin/signup etc.)
* Do a lot of code cleanups/optimizations (**Some questions**: can any optimizations be made to the architecture of the components? can any optimizations be made to prevent unnecessary rendering? Are the components/classes/ids namesd for optimal readablilty? Are the components using semantic enough elements?) ! 
* Write tests
